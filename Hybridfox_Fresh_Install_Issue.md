When installing Hybridfox for the first time, if you cannot find some text next to "Regions" button, it means Hybridfox is not installed properly (due to a bug). As a workaround follow the following steps:

  1. Launch Hybridfox from the tools menu of Firefox.
  1. Click on “Regions” button.
  1. Click on “cancel” on the dialog that appears.
  1. Click on “Credentials” button.
  1. Click on “cancel” on the dialog that appears.
  1. Close Hybridfox.

When you open Hybridfox the next time it will work fine.
