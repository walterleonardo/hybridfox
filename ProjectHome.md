# What is Hybridfox? #

Hybridfox is a Firefox add-on that attempts to get the best of popular public and private Cloud Computing environments. Currently it supports [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), [Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com/), [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/), [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/) and [HP cloud](http://hpcloud.com/) environments. The idea is to use a tool providing a single interface to switch seamlessly between multiple cloud accounts in order to manage your "Cloud Computing" environment. It offers complete GUI for Amazon Web Services like [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), [Spot Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/) and [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). It is also localized in Japanese and Chinese languages with the help of community support



&lt;BR&gt;



# What can Hybridfox do? #

Hybridfox can help you to do everything that you could possibly do with Elasticfox, on the Eucalyptus Computing environment

  * Manage Images
  * Raise and Stop Instances
  * Manage Instances
  * Manage Elastic IPs
  * Manage Security Groups
  * Manage Key-pairs
  * Manage Elastic Block Storage



&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;



# Why this Project? #

There something about the Elasticfox development that restricts it only to EC2 environment. But Manoj (the maintainer of Elasticfox) has done well to keep it open source, so that people like us could just take it further, and hence this project.

It would be nice if the community gets involved and extends this a little further.

**Caveat:** Hybridfox is an extension of an earlier version of Elasticfox, 1.6.x.



&lt;BR&gt;




# Why not Elasticfox for Eucalyptus? #

Hybridfox development is more focused on supporting all features of Eucalyptus without breaking the EC2 functionality.



&lt;BR&gt;



# 1.7! Whats that? #

Thanks to David Kavanagh, from Eucalyptus Inc. We are out with 1.7, hybridfox, with all the features of Hybridfox and the latest of features of Elasticfox. Apart from that he has also included some cool features like.

  * Specifying an Endpoint(Region) as Eucalytpus or not
  * Defining a Default account for a particular region
  * Support for latest AWS Signing convention(which is also the Eucalyptus Enterprise's convention)
